# sqlalchemy-challenge
 
This code analyzes climate data for Honolulu, Hawaii. It performs a precipitation analysis and a station analysis, using Python, SQLAlchemy, Pandas, and Matplotlib. The precipitation analysis finds the last 12 months of precipitation data, summarizes it, and plots the results. The station analysis finds the total number of stations and the most-active station, and also plots the temperature observations for the most-active station over the last 12 months. Finally, the code creates a Flask API with routes for retrieving the precipitation, station, and temperature data.
